Handcrafter Descriptors vs Learned Descriptors

• Improved accuracy to 97% by integrating Handcrafter and Learned Descriptors, which the accuracy is 75 %
with Learned Descriptors Model and 65% with Handcrafter Descriptors Model
• Built CNN models and SIFT models as Learned and Handcrafter Descriptors using Torch in Python
